# Introduction

The natural course of life raises the question of the successor to the Founder. This set of rules is a universal protocol of continuation.

# 1. Direct transfer of Founder’s rights:

## 1.1. During his legal capacity, the Founder can independently determine the sole or collegial heir of his authority - the Keeper.

Only the original founder can be called as Founder.

## 1.2. In the same way, the Keeper can appoint his successor.

## 1.3. The Keeper may begin to fulfill his functions immediately, if that does not contradict the decisions of a competent source of such powers.

## 1.4. The source of the Keeper’s authority may revoke its decision at any time.

## 1.5. The Founder and Keeper cannot relinquish their powers.


# 2. Rejection of the Keeper:

## 2.1. The community has the right to reject the successor in the same way as the Founder - exit from the community.

## 2.2. The community has the right to vote to select another Keeper or form an organization of such Keeper.

## 2.3. The Keeper performs its functions until the moment of choosing another Keeper.


# 3. Keeper Choices:

## 3.1. The election of the Keeper is conducted exclusively by open voting.

The principles of the Confederation imply consent and harmony as opposed to forced submission.

## 3.2. Elections can be held by any member of the community.

This process can be carried out in parallel by various members of the community for transparent voting.

## 3.3. The community Statute may determine what members have the right to vote.

## 3.4. A Keeper may be selected only with the consent of all its members with voting rights.

The voting process is not limited in time and space. Any forgery is instantly revealed to dissenting voters.

## 3.5. Voters can change their choices until everyone comes to the same decision.

Accordingly, each change of choice should be recorded in a way that makes it possible to determine the last decision.

## 3.6. Inability to reach consensus means the actual cessation of the community's existence in its original form, if there is no capable Keeper.

The community itself may continue to exist, but it is devoid of legal development.

If the minority considers it necessary to save the community in such a situation, he is invited to voluntarily leave it. The division of joint ownership and rights when members leave is established by the Statute.

Fragmentation of the community and the formation of new ones in case of insurmountable disagreements are considered to be natural processes of development and they should not be perceived as tragic.

In this situation, none of the fragments can consider themselves the exclusive successor of the original community.
