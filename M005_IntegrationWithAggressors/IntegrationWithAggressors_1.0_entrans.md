# Introduction

In the understanding of the Confederation, any sovereign state greedily occupying territory is the aggressor because it seeks to impose its authority without taking into account the interests of others. The local and international legislation of these aggressors is structured in a such way to equate any openly defending subject to especially dangerous criminals. Despite the lack of collusion and non-participation in a hypothetical conflict, all members of the defending community are also equated with criminals. In this regard, the community needs to clearly state its position and distance itself from violent measures.

Among the aggressors, there are generally accepted norms on diplomatic and military immunity in which a representative of one party formally observes the norms of the accepting party, but in fact remains within its legal field and obeys only its laws. Such a model is adopted for integration.

Peaceful open presence in the zone of influence of the aggressor requires formal compliance with the imposed norms. Therefore, certain standards of behavior are required under the yoke of the aggressor.

The aggressors take for themselves the exclusive right to legal proceedings, and such actions of free residents are equated with crime. Therefore, a special mechanism of the institute of retribution is being worked out, which protects the victim by introducing unidentified persons and excluding the judicial process as such.


# 1. Non-violence

## 1.1. The community refuses violence under its auspices.

## 1.2. The community allows private retribution and self-defense.

## 1.3. Any violence committed by several community members is not a community action.


# 2. Formal conformity

## 2.1. In order to avoid open conflicts, community members can formally follow the order established by the aggressor.

## 2.2. Under formal conformity, community members can make optional written and verbal reservations about it. A reservation is any mention of "formal conformity" in direct or veiled form.

## 2.3. Any formal conformity necessary for the realization of the will of a community member invalidates any commitments made, does not constitute a recognition of authority over oneself and does not constitute acceptance of imposed norms.


# 3. Institute of retribution

## 3.1. Any subject has the right to designate reasoned claims and to demand satisfaction.

## 3.2. The absence of a response from the addressee of the claims or a non-substantive response is an admission of guilt.

## 3.3. The state of affairs and additional information about the person called to answer may be published at the discretion of the subject. Publicity is an allowance for retribution by any person.

## 3.4. The principle of free will allows any rational being, at its discretion, to assess the situation and to perform retribution without involving the victim or the community.

## 3.5. Any other subject has the right to collect and anonymously publish any other information about the party called to answer.

## 3.6. Claims can be transferred in any form to any authority or representatives of the aggressor which imposes its jurisdiction in resolving a particular dispute. The aggressor bears responsibility for the claims themselves and for informing the person held in charge.

## 3.7. All actions on claims require particularly strict adherence to the principle of accuracy of information.

## 3.8. A call to answer may be issued by third disinterested party with the consent of the subject.
