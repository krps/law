# Introduction

The modern World legal system is based on objectives governance and factual ownership of inhabitants. This is note hidden in document - political interests prevail over human rights. The population of the planet has never voted for international law. Freedom is replaced with liberty - permissible deviation from imposed regulation. The will of majority controlled by minority is promoted to unshakable law. Obviously imperfect and constantly changing legislation is put above common sense and goodwill of a human. Initial excuses for restriction of people's freedom in favor of a state lost own meaning too long time ago. The states in turn refuses to execute own law, if that's against its interests.

The norms set out below bring human kind back to the origins of law before the conventional transfer of human will and power to a state in good faith. The full power and will is left for each human. A state jurisdiction is defined on own citizens instead of territory. Subordination to a state is voluntary. The state is a platform for standardized interaction, provisioning of public services in benefit of consumers compared to self implementation, and collective protection of interests. Many states may coexist on a single territory. Savage measures for imprisonment and forced subordination get completely abolished, but the limit for sanctions for malicious acts is absent. A victim determines and executes punishment on its own, what does not exclude a possibility for negotiations of compensation. Citizens of civilized world should use corresponding institutes of a state. For any excesses, citizens have right to answer with insubordination. As soon as some state does not meet expectations, its citizens can change their citizenship or exit such citizenship to found own state without obstructions. If some citizens behave self inadequate then the majority may drive them out of citizenship and deny access to services provided by the state. Conflicts because of limited resources are solved based on principles of equal opportunity, infrastructural elements assume optimized joint usage instead of duplication. Information in a broad sense becomes a vital object. It is unacceptable to intentionally distort and distribute such information as authentic. Instead of distribution of labor and resulting from that dependency, self-sufficiency is promoted.
