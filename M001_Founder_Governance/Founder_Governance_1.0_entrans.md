# Introduction

Certainly, every developed state with well-established society and values is able to choose its course by collective will, but the states at the beginning of their life path simply cannot afford to be scattered over the political struggle. For the quickest possible formation, the strongest and most authoritarian governance is required. In conditions when each person is a carrier of power, such government does not create danger, since citizens are not obliged to obey and can always change citizenship or even have several of them.
This module of law defines the set of norms of an authoritarian-dictatorial type.

# 1. The Founder of a state has the full and unrestricted right to accept all the norms of the state, speak on behalf of the state and have the last word in expressing the opinion of the state in disputes between citizens.

# 2. No state authority can accept norms without the approval of the Founder.

# 3. Citizens' subordination is based solely on a voluntary basis. At any time, a citizen may refuse to trust the Founder and withdraw from the citizenship of the state.

# 4. If there is more than one founder, then the procedure for agreement between the founders and decision making is determined by the state's Statute. In this case, the Founder means the aggregate of all the founders.

# 5. It is highly desirable to have a tool for expression of free will of citizens as a means of feedback.
