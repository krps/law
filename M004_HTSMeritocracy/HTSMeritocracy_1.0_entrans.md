# Introduction

There are various forms of meritocracy, even contradicting the values of the High Technology State (HTS) and the Confederation of Reasonable Legal Freedom (CRLF). This document forms the abstract principles of self-government for community members in the style of the HTS.

These principles can applied both to a whole community and to its individual subgroups.

As a special case, members and the community can be understood as citizens and a state.

# 1. About the purpose of the community:

## 1.1. Continuity is a value.

## 1.2. A change of course is set by the Statute, which is managed by the Founder (Keeper).

## 1.3. The last word in assessing the degree of continuity and matching of continuity remains with the Founder (Keeper).


# 2. Members are divided into three ranks:

## 2.1. First rank - able to independently manage and make decisions in accordance with the values of the community.

## 2.2. The second rank - able to independently act in accordance with the values of the community.

## 2.3. The third rank - not included in the first two ranks.


# 3. Admission of new members and determination of rank.

## 3.1. The Founder (Keeper), by definition, belongs to the first rank and is inviolable in its status.

## 3.2. Community members receive first rank with the consent of all members of the first rank.

## 3.3. Community members receive a second rank with the consent of a simple majority of members of the first rank or a special commission of members of the first rank.

## 3.4. New members are accepted to the third rank with the consent of any member of the first rank and their own consent for membership in the community.

## 3.5. The community may establish additional checks and/or tests to assign a rank.

## 3.6. The Founder (Keeper) can lower in rank anyone or deprive membership in the community.

## 3.7. A simple majority of members of the first rank or a special commission of members of the first rank can lower in rank or deprive membership in the community of the second and third rank members.

## 3.8. A special commission is created on the basis of the community Statute and only if it is provided for.


# 4. Hierarchy goals:

## 4.1. The community does not establish its power by force - every member is a member of the community by their own will.

## 4.2. The hierarchy is recognized to protect the integrity and goals of the community.

## 4.3. The hierarchy is established on the basis of ranks without limiting the number and thus gives equal opportunities for each member.

## 4.4. Regardless of rank, each member of the organization has the right to take the initiative.


# 5. Representation and decision making.

## 5.1. Mandatory decisions for all members of the community require unanimous approval of members of the first rank.

## 5.2. Members of the first rank independently assume responsibility and act in the interests of the community, both in internal and external matters outside the framework of the norms of the Statute.

## 5.3. Members of the second rank act independently within the framework of the norms of the Statute.

## 5.4. Members of the third rank operate under the leadership of the first and second rank members.

## 5.5. All members act together and themselves determine the desired degree of interaction.

## 5.6. The actions of its members, which are harmful to the interests of the community, can be the cause of a decrease in rank or deprivation of membership in relation to the guilty one.

## 5.7. Naturally, individual members become more competent in specific areas and other members are required to consult with them about non-standard issues.

## 5.8. Especially responsible areas of the community can be assigned to individual competent members or their groups.

## 5.9. The Statute may establish a specific procedure for making certain standard decisions in order to avoid natural chaos.

## 5.10. The order of document circulation, keeping registers and protocols is determined by the Statute of the community.
